# CTF-writeups

Welcome to the **CTF-writeups** repository! This collection contains detailed write-ups for various Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges I have participated in.

## Overview

Each write-up includes:

- **Overview:** A brief summary of the challenge scenario.
- **Vulnerability Analysis:** Identification and explanation of the security issues or logic flaws exploited.
- **Exploitation Steps:** A step-by-step breakdown of the techniques used to solve the challenge, often accompanied by code snippets and scripts.

The repository covers challenges from multiple domains such as:

- Web Security
- Reverse Engineering

Whether you're a seasoned CTF veteran or just starting out, I hope these write-ups serve as a valuable resource for learning and inspiration.
